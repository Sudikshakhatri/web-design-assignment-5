<h2 style="text-align:center"> ABOUT COVID-19 </h2>
<p> Human coronoviruses were discovered in the 1960s. They were isolated using two
    different methods in the United Kingdom and the United States.
    The virus was not able to be cultivated using standard techniques which had
    successfully cultivated rhinoviruses, adenoviruses and the other known common
    cold viruses. Other human coronoviruses have been identified , including SARS-CoV
    in 2003, HCoV NL63 in 2004, HCoV HKU1 in 2005, MERS-CoV in 2012, and SARS-CoV-2 
    in 2019.</p>

<p> Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.

The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 

The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory
 etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).</p>
