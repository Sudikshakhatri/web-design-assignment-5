<h2> What is self awareness? </h2>
<p>Self-awareness is the ability to see yourself clearly and objectively through reflection and introspection.

While it may not be possible to attain total objectivity about oneself (that’s a debate that continues to rage throughout the history of philosophy), there are certainly degrees of self-awareness. It exists on a spectrum.

Although everyone has a fundamental idea of what self-awareness is, we don’t know exactly where it comes from, what its precursors are, or why some of us seem to have more or less than others. 

This is where the Self-Awareness Theory comes in, offering some potential answers to questions like these.</p>

<p2> The following self-awareness measures are taken by the people in society: </p2>
<h3> Keep things clean </h3>
<p>Preventative measures are your first line of defense. The best way to protect yourself from COVID-19 is to practice good hygiene and to make these CDC recommendations part of your routine:

<br><ul><li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
<li>If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
<li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands. If you don’t have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your elbow, rather than into your hands.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</li></ul>
  

<h3> Wear a cloth face mask </h3>
<p>On April 3, the CDC changed its guidelines on face masks, recommending that people wear cloth face coverings in public settings. This is especially encouraged in situations where social distancing is difficult to maintain (such as in a grocery store or pharmacy) 
and in areas of significant community-based transmission. According to the CDC, studies have shown that individuals with the novel coronavirus could be asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic, prompting them to make this new recommendation. While this measure is intended
 to help mitigate the spread, it’s important to note that it does not replace social distancing recommendations. In addition, surgical masks and N-95 respirators 
should remain reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.</p>

<h3> Avoid close contact </h3>
<p>The CDC recommends maintaining a distance of approximately 6 feet from others in public places since respiratory droplets produced by coughing or sneezing do not travel more than 6 feet. While at home, remind everyone to practice everyday preventive actions – 
such as washing hands and wiping down surfaces – to help reduce the risk of getting sick. If you are symptomatic and have tested positive for COVID-19 but do not require hospitalization, you should stay in a specific “sick room” and away from other people in your 
home as much as possible and use a separate bathroom, if available. If your living space makes it difficult to keep a 6-foot distance, stay as far apart as you can and continue to practice good hygiene and wear a mask.</p>

<h3>Restrict your travel </h3>
<p>Many states have put out the call for individuals to stay home, except to make essential trips to the grocery store, pharmacy or for some outdoor exercise.

The CDC recommends that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to China, Iran, most European countries, the United Kingdom and Ireland. Most foreign nationals who have been in one of these countries during the previous 14 days
 will not be allowed to enter the United States. “For people at risk for the complications of COVID-19, such as those with underlying medical conditions or those who are older, it’s prudent to avoid any long-distance 
travel,” says Dr. Goldberg.</p>
