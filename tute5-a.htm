<h2 style="text-align:center"> SITUATION OF INDIA IN THIS EPIDEMIC </h2> 
<p><img src= "images.jfif" style="float:right;width:300px"><i>India reported the first confirmed case of the coronavirus infection on 30 January 2020 in the state of Kerala. 
 The affected had a travel history from Wuhan, China. Thousands of suspected cases have been tested resulting in
 morethan 2,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in India. The regions with the highest number of cases include 
 Maharastra, Kerala, Delhi, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu.

 Two cases were reported in Nagpur, Maharashtra, on 13 March. An employee of Google in Bangalore tested 
 positive on 13 March, while a COVID-19 positive case was confirmed in Noida on the same day.

 First death due to coronavirus in India was reported in Karnataka on 12 March. A total of 52 deaths have been
 reported in the country.</i></p>
<h3 style="text-align:center"> ROLE OF INDIA GOVERNMENT</h3>
<p><i> The Indian government has so far followed a step-by-step model and been on the front foot with early screening
at airports from mid-January onwards, initiating travel restrictions and in collaboration with states, applying
restrictions on events and on places of social gathering including restaurants, theatres and gyms. Such a response 
ensured that there was no panic among the citizens and avoided inconvenience to the extent possible. The Indian
government has also evacuated more than 1400 of its citizens and those of its neighbours from high-risk countries, 
including China, Japan, Iran and Italy. This is not the first time that India has evacuated its citizens and those 
of other countries during such crises to ensure their safety and security.<br>
<br>


<p><i><img src= "gov.webp" style="float:left"> <br>The government will need to take steps to protect those most vulnerable to COVID-19, such as those 
with prior conditions or without insurance. Italy’s National Health Authority this week stated that more than 99 percent of 
Italy’s coronavirus fatalities were people who suffered from previous medical conditions: more than 75% had high blood pressure, 
about 35% had diabetes and a third suffered from heart disease. The scope of Ayushman Bharat, India’s flagship insurance/assurance 
scheme launched with the vision of universal healthcare and leaving no one behind, should be expanded to include the 40% ‘missing 
middle’ who are neither covered by private insurance nor by the government, so that any COVID-19-related expenses are covered by 
the government.The government must also continue to ensure constant, consistent and credible communication to provide necessary 
public health guidance and to allay any fears and panic among the populace. A good example of such a communication is in the state 
of Kerala, which successfully managed the Nipah virus in 2018. Here the Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Health Minister K.K. 
Shailaja have been giving a press conference every day at 7 pm to update and educate the state’s citizens. In many ways, Kerala 
is a benchmark in pandemic preparedness and action and other states can emulate its successful ways.One such example of real-time 
and dynamic updates on India's response to COVID-19 is Invest India's Business Immunity Platform. This unified platform can bring 
together the public and private sector to fight this pandemic.

This pandemic will likely highlight our state capacity or the gaps in it. From trained medical professionals to managing the scale 
of COVID-19 to the ability of the state to manage a crisis through a multi-ministry/department in an integrated way.</i></p>
