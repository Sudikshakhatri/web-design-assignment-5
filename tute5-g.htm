<h1 style="text-align:center"> EFFECT ON AGRICULTURE, BUSINESS & EDUCATION </h1>
<h3 style="text-align:center">Effect of Agriculture </h3>
<p><i> <img src="h.jpg" style="float:left;width:400px;height:400px"><br>The ongoing health crisis around COVID19 has affected all walks of life. Protecting lives of people suffering from the disease as well as frontline health responders have been 
the priority of nations. Governments have swung into actions since the Corona virus attack created an unprecedented situation. India declared a three-week nation-wide lockdown till 
mid-April in the initial phase, which was subsequently extended for achieving satisfactory containment of the virus spread.<br>

<br>During these challenging times, how does Indian Agriculture respond to the crisis and how do government measures affect 140 million farm households across the country and thereafter 
impact the economy of a very important country in the developing world? We assess the immediate challenges that COVID19 has posed to the farm sector and suggest mitigation measures to 
ensure a sustainable food system in the post-crisis period.<br>

<br>Immediately after the nation-wide lockdown was announced, the Indian Finance Minister declared an INR 1.7 trillion package, mostly to protect the vulnerable sections
 (including farmers) from any adverse impacts of the Corona pandemic. The announcement, among a slew of benefits, contained advance release of INR 2000 to bank accounts of farmers as 
income support under PM-KISAN scheme. The Government also raised the wage rate for workers engaged under the NREGS, world’s largest wage guarantee scheme. Under the special scheme to 
take care of the vulnerable population, Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (Prime Minister’s scheme for welfare of the poor), has been announced. Additional grain allotments to registered 
beneficiaries were also announced for the next three months. Cash and food assistance to persons engaged in the informal sector, mostly migrant laborers, have also been announced for
 which a separate PM-CARES (Prime Minister Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations) fund has been created.<br>

<h3 style="text-align:center"> Effect of Business </h3>

<p><i><img src="bus.jpg" style="float:right;width:400px;height:400px"><br>The impact of the Corona virus pandemic will be felt by organisations beyond six months, according to the findings of a survey conducted by professional services firm EY.<br>

<br>The survey, which incorporates first-hand perspective of human resource heads of over 100 organisations across sectors in India on the impact of COVID-19, showed that while the COVID-19 impact can be felt by organisations across sectors, 72% of the organisations stated that its impact will be felt even after
 six months.<br>

<br>The survey titled ‘HR resilience planning - COVID-19 impact and preparedness’ showed that around 70% of the organisations believe that the single biggest concern for continued remote working is fall in productivity.<br>

<br>“Today, organisations are grappling with an unprecedented crisis that is fundamentally different from what they have ever experienced. In this hour of crisis, the HR function has to be a business partner in anticipating change, co-creating a range of scenarios
 and planning for the future,” Anurag Malik, Partner and India Workforce Advisory Leader, People Advisory Services, EY India said. 
“It is also the right time for the HR Heads to recalibrate their priorities, focus towards managing remote workforce, digitalize the HR function, and re-imagine workforce models,” he said.<br>

<br>The crisis is also forcing organisations to re-look at the HR processes and operations through a digital lens. More than 70% of the organizations are now moving to virtual methods of recruitment, and emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Robotic Process Automation and Machine Learning are
 leading this change.<br></p>

<h3 style="text-align:center"> Effect of Education </h3>
<p><i><img src="dist.webp" style="float:left;width=400;height:400px"><br>The COVID-19 pandemic is first and foremost a health crisis. Many countries have (rightly) decided to close schools, colleges and universities. 

The crisis crystallises the dilemma policymakers are facing between closing schools (reducing contact and saving lives) and keeping them open (allowing workers to work and maintaining the economy). The severe short-term disruption is felt by many
 families around the world: home schooling is not only a massive shock to parents’ productivity, but also to children’s social life and learning. Teaching is moving online, on an untested and unprecedented scale. Student assessments are also moving online, 
with a lot of trial and error and uncertainty for everyone. Many assessments have simply been cancelled. Importantly, these interruptions will not just be a short-term issue, but can also have long-term consequences for the affected cohorts and are likely to increase
 inequality.  <br>

<br>Needless to say, the pandemic has transformed the centuries-old, chalk–talk teaching model to one driven by technology. This disruption in the delivery of education is pushing policymakers to figure out how to drive engagement at scale while ensuring inclusive e-learning solutions and tackling the 
digital divide.<br>

<br>A multi-pronged strategy is necessary to manage the crisis and build a resilient Indian education system in the long term.<br>

<br>One, immediate measures are essential to ensure continuity of learning in government schools and universities. Open-source digital learning solutions and Learning Management Software should be adopted so teachers can conduct teaching online. The DIKSHA platform, with reach across all states in India, 
can be further strengthened to ensure accessibility of learning to the students.<br></p>
