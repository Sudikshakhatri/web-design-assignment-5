<h2> Impact on enviroment:</h2>
<p>Lockdowns restricting travel and industry imposed to halt the spread of coronavirus have resulted in unprecedented reductions in deadly air pollution around the world, new analysis shows.

Major cities that suffer from the world’s worst air pollution have seen reductions of deadly particulate matter by up to 60% from the previous year, during a three-week lockdowns period.

Researchers from IQAir — a global air quality information and tech company — studied 10 major cities around the world that have relatively high numbers of coronavirus cases and COVID-19 lockdown measures.

The study compared levels of harmful microscopic particulate matter known as PM 2.5. The pollutant, which is smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, is considered particularly dangerous as it can lodge deep into the lungs and pass into other organs and the bloodstream, causing serious health risks.

Seven out of the 10 cities studied, including New Delhi, Seoul, Wuhan and Mumbai, saw significant improvements in air quality. Those with historically higher levels of PM2.5 pollution witnessed the most substantial drops in pollution.

Analysts chose the three-week timeframe to reflect either the period with the strictest lockdowns, or — during longer lockdown periods such as in Wuhan — to coincide with the peak number of daily reported coronavirus cases.

The report was released to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, which this year is focused on climate action.

Air pollution is already a global public health crisis, as it kills seven million people each year, according to the World Health Organization. Reducing global heat-trapping emissions is the best way to clean up our skies and prevent avoidable pollution-related deaths, scientists say.

The report’s authors say that while they do expect air pollution to rise again when economies restart after coronavirus, “out of these extraordinary circumstances, we can see how changes in our society’s activities can have a momentous
 impact on our environment and the air we breathe,” said IQAir’s marketing specialist Kelsey Duska.</p>

<p>The observations by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) come at a time when the government is considering extending the 21-day lockdown. ICMR described lockdowns as a “drastic public health measure".

In a review of the current evidence on covid-19, published in the latest issue of Indian Journal of Medical Research, ICMR said the experience of Wuhan, the Chinese epicentre of the pandemic showed that while the benefits of a lockdown remain to be seen, its long-lasting negative impact should not be underplayed.

“Such drastic measures can lead to social, psychological and economic stressors on the whole population, leading to long-lasting adverse health outcomes," said lead author Dr Pranab Chatterjee, translational global health policy research cell-ICMR, in the paper, which is aimed at informing India’s public health response.

Instead of coercive top-down quarantine approaches, it said community- and civil society-led self-quarantine and self-monitoring could be more sustainable and implementable strategies in a “protracted pandemic like covid-19".

Reviewing the World Health Organization’s (WHO), International Health Regulations (IHR) that are an international legal instrument that is binding on 194 countries across the globe, the ICMR paper said that in keeping with these 
regulations the health ministry had banned all travel to and from China. However, it cast doubts on the medium- and long-term impact of such travel bans.</p>
