<h1 style="text-align:center"> Effect on social gathering and meetings in future </h1>

<p> In only a few months, the coronavirus pandemic has upended the daily lives of people around the world. For Americans, the economic impact of the virus has led to new categorizations of “essential” workers,
 a large-scale move to remote work and skyrocketing unemployment that is expected to continue increasing.<br> 

<br>With more than 30 million people filing for unemployment in the past six weeks, the U.S. is predicted to experience a coronavirus-induced recession through 2021.<br>

<br>And amid stay-at-home orders across the country, office workers have ditched their daily commutes to work from dining room tables, couches and beds in their own homes. 
Many may find themselves in this situation for the long haul, as businesses struggle to find a path forward while restrictions slowly lift.<br>

<p><img src="cov.jpg" style="height:300px;width:300px">Even after New Jersey’s coronavirus lockdown rules loosen and businesses begin to reopen, residents should expect some restrictions to remain for a while and not an immediate return to the way life was before,
 Gov. Phil Murphy said .<br>
<br>“A normal gathering in the foreseeable future, I just don’t see it," he added.

Murphy provided a glimpse Wednesday into what some examples of reopened businesses would look like, including restaurants that could start offering dine-in options again with temperature checks or rapid coronavirus saliva tests at the door.

“I could see the restaurant protocol,” the governor said, while offering no timeline. “You go inside, the servers are masked and gloved. You’re at 50% capacity.”

Murphy also said some traditional greetings may be avoided for some time.<br></p>
