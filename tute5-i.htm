<h1 style="text-align:center"> ROLE OF MOBILE APPS </h1>
<p><img src="mob.jpg" style="float:right;width:300px;height:300px"><br>Providing information, self-assessment clues, and even remote healthcare and contact tracing, mobile apps are becoming a key element in the response to coronavirus.<br>

<br>As social distancing and confinement strategies implemented worldwide call for new ways of communication, both public authorities and private initiatives are increasingly making use of apps to reach the
 population.<br>

<br>Mobile apps are indeed bridging the distance between citizens and organisations, but also have a potentially crucial role in tackling the next phase of coronavirus response. Contact tracing and 
tracking apps have become popular in East Asia and are credited for part of their success containing the virus. Currently, the approach varies throughout different societies, with a trend towards favouring
 these apps in support of public health authorities.<br></p>

<p><img src="mobi.jpg" style="float:right;width:300px;height:300px"><br>A popular response among technologists has been to develop surveillance apps on smartphones, for contact tracing to keep tab on the
 disease spread, for geofencing to enforce quarantine, and for gathering data for modelling the spread of the contagion. Indeed, there are several reports of efforts and successes of such endeavours from
 all over, and several commentators have alluded to the possibility of pervasive under-the-skin surveillance in a post-COVID world.<br>

<br>There has also been a spurt of indigenous efforts to build such apps, and there is unbridled enthusiasm among our students of technology to pitch in. It is indeed true that contact tracing is 
crucial for effective combating of the spread of the contagion, but can it be done accurately and reliably with such hurriedly engineered apps? Some caution perhaps is in order, especially related to
 the risks and reliability.</p>
