<h1 style="text-align:center"> EFFECT ON POOR FAMILY AND HELP BY SOCIETY </h1>
<h3 style="text-align:center"> Effect on poor family </h3>
<p><img src="poor.jpg" style="float:left;width:450px;height:300px"><br>The world has witnessed a huge economic shock due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Starting with China, a majority of countries has adopted some version of a lockdown 
of all social activity. In India, the lockdown started across the country on March 24 and is still ongoing. Many commentators have highlighted the plight of the poorest sections of society, particularly migrants who are trudging miles
 to be back home, having lost their daily wages and now depend on either the government support or private charity for food and shelter.<br>

<br>However, less (if anything at all) is known about how low-income families living in urban shanty towns are faring due to the crisis. What has been the impact of the shutdown on their earnings and incomes? While the state
 and Central governments have responded with various measures to mitigate economic hardships, such as food transfers or camps, and cash injections directly into bank accounts, how effective have these policy responses been in 
reaching the low-income households in urban clusters?<br>

<br>In the absence of hard data on the impact of the ongoing crisis, the only window we have into understanding the condition of workers in urban India is anecdotal. However, relatively large-scale phone surveys are one
 possible method for gauging the ground reality. But a phone survey that is representative, and hence reliable, is a challenge even in normal times in India where the poor either have limited access to phones and/or change phone
 numbers frequently. An existing database of respondents can potentially address some of the issues related to the representativeness of a phone survey.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center"> Help by society </h3>
<p><img src="help.webp" style="float:left;width:450px;height:400px"><br>India, the poor are always an afterthought. It seems strange, given that it is a country where millions of people live in extreme poverty, but that is how things
 have always been. And, it wasn't any different on Tuesday night either, when the Indian government announced a nationwide lockdown for a period of 21-days to curb the spread of coronavirus.<br>

<br>As the privileged section of the society panicked and hoarded up for their Netflix and chill sessions at home during the lockdown, many remained blithely oblivious to the fact that thanks to their hoarding, food prices are skyrocketing. Which means most informal 
sector workers, who do not have any job right now and are perhaps stuck in a city where they are migrant labourers and therefore have no home, will soon not have the money to feed themselves the bare minimum required to stay alive.<br>

<br>State governments of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala and a few others have announced special packages and relief funds for such individuals. Today, the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also announced a relief package
 of Rs 1.7 lakh crore to help the poor of the country navigate through these bad times. However, state and central government efforts alone will not be enough. Therefore, it is important, for citizens, civic bodies, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) as well as 
industry leaders, to come together to help the marginalised section.<br>

<br>So far, some NGOs and companies have shown great enterprise and tried to ease the distress of marginalised individuals during the lockdown. Listed here are few NGOs and companies which have started campaigns to gather funds for the poor, or organised volunteer
 services to help elderly
