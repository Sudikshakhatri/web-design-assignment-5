<p><img src="coronavirus-shutter-4.jpg" style="float:left;width:500px;height:400px"><br>Most people who become ill with COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. No specific treatments for COVID-19 exist right now. But some of the same things you do to feel better if you 
have the flu — getting enough rest, staying well hydrated, and taking medications to relieve fever and aches and pains — also help with COVID-19.

In the meantime, scientists are working hard to develop effective treatments. Therapies that are under investigation include drugs that have been used to treat malaria and autoimmune 
diseases; antiviral drugs that were developed for other viruses, and antibodies from people who have recovered from COVID-19.</p>
<p2>What is convalescent plasma? How could it help people with COVID-19?</p2>
<p> When people recover from COVID-19, their blood contains antibodies that their bodies produced to fight the coronavirus and help them get well. Antibodies are found in plasma, a component of blood.<br>

Convalescent plasma — literally plasma from recovered patients — has been used for more than 100 years to treat a variety of illnesses from measles to polio, chickenpox, and SARS. In the current situation, 
antibody-containing plasma from a recovered patient is given by transfusion to a patient who is suffering from COVID-19. The donor antibodies help the patient fight the illness, possibly shortening the length 
or reducing the severity of the disease.<br>
Though convalescent plasma has been used for many years, and with varying success, not much is known about how effective it is for treating COVID-19. There have been reports of success from China, but no randomized, 
controlled studies (the gold standard for research studies) have been done. Experts also don't yet know the best time during the course of the illness to give plasma.<br>
On March 24th, the FDA began allowing convalescent plasma to be used in patients with serious or immediately life-threatening COVID-19 infections. This treatment is still considered experimental.</p>
<p3 style="text-align:center">Who can donate plasma for COVID-19?</p3>
<p>In order to donate plasma, a person must meet several criteria. They have to have tested positive for COVID-19, recovered, have no symptoms for 14 days, currently test negative for COVID-19, and have high enough antibody 
levels in their plasma. A donor and patient must also have compatible blood types. Once plasma is donated, it is screened for other infectious diseases, such as HIV.<br>

Each donor produces enough plasma to treat one to three patients. Donating plasma should not weaken the donor's immune system nor make the donor more susceptible to getting reinfected with the virus.</p>
<p3 style="text-align:center">Is there an antiviral treatment for COVID-19?</p3>
<p>Currently there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.<br>

However, drugs previously developed to treat other viral infections are being tested to see if they might also be effective against the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>
<p3 style="text-align:center">What treatments are available to treat coronavirus?</p3>
<p>Currently there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. However, similar to treatment of any viral infection, these measures can help:

<br><ul><li>While you don't need to stay in bed, you should get plenty of rest.</li>
<li>Stay well hydrated.</li>
<li>To reduce fever and ease aches and pains, take acetaminophen. Be sure to follow directions. If you are taking any combination cold or flu medicine, keep 
track of all the ingredients and the doses. For acetaminophen, the total daily dose from all products should not exceed 3,000 milligrams.</li></ul></p>
